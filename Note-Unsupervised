Steps:

-exploratory analysis
data description(data summary, featured variables)(num: %pop, unique, mean, st, min, median, max, distribution)(cate:%pop, unique, bar)

-create variables
consult expert to create synthetic variables
base variables, normalized variables(num, scale base value), grouped varaibles(cate, group record, fill missing, scale base)

-data cleaning

-build model
scaled variables
PCA (principle coponent analysis)->top 10 principal components
scaled pricipal components
two models and two scores (reconstruction error of antoencoder;Manhattan Distance of the parameters)
aggregated result from two models (average quantile score)



Evaluation:
top 10 unusal properties: disproportiate value in relation to its size location and tax class
